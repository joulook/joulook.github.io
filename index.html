<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p><strong>Hello, visitor!</strong> I’m Mohammad (you can also call me KC), a PhD student in the Rigorous Software Engineering group at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)</a> in Germany, supervised by <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rupak Majumdar</a>. My main research focus is on the automated systematic verification of concurrent and distributed software, using dynamic partial order reduction and symbolic execution techniques. In tandem with my theoretical work on software verification, I also develop practical tools for software model checking.</p> <p>In particular, I am a core developer of the <a href="https://jmc.mpi-sws.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Java Model Checker (JMC)</strong></a>, a stateless model checker designed for verifying and testing concurrent and distributed Java programs. My current research interests encompass formal verification, model checking, concurrency theory, the theory of distributed systems, automata theory, temporal logic, and database theory. If you are interested in these topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to me!</p> <p>Before joining MPI-SWS, I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.sharif.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> in Iran, where I worked on the specification and verification of timed distributed systems under the supervision of <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~movaghar/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ali Movaghar</a> and <a href="https://marjansirjani.github.io/Marjan-Sirjani/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Marjan Sirjani</a>. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the <a href="http://www.azad.ac.ir/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Azad University, South Tehran Branch</a> in Iran, where I worked on the theory of non-first normal form (NF2) databases under the supervision of Amir Hossein Rouhani Seraji.</p> </body></html>
