I am happy to advise students for their Bachelor or Master theses, practical work, or internships. Some example projects
that I currently have available are listed below. If you are interested in working with me, **please don't hesitate to
contact me!** Even if you have a different idea, I am always open to discussing new topics.

- DPOR-based semantics for Virtual Threads in Java and Coroutines in Kotlin
- Blocking and unblocking DPOR-based semantics for thread synchronization in Java programs
- Fuzzing concurrent and distributed Java programs using DPOR-based notion of coverage
- Random testing of concurrent and distributed Java programs using Coupon collector's problem
- Optimal, sound, and complete DPOR-based model checking of Java Thread Pools
- DPOR actor-based model checking for the Akka framework 
- DPOR-based predicate abstraction for reasoning about unbounded concurrent and distributed Java programs
- Verification of networked processes using rendezvous communication (e.g., wait and notify in Java)
- Leveraging Lipton reduction with DPOR for coarser equivalence partitions in model checking Java programs
- Parametric verification of distributed systems using well-quasi DPOR
- Optimal DPOR-based semantics for Java Memory Model JMM
- Timed DPOR for verifying timestamped-based distributed protocols
- Extending MuSt over gRPC and Netty
- DPOR-based IC3-style model checking for unbounded concurrent and distributed Java programs
