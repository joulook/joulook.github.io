**Hello, visitor!** I'm Mohammad (you can also call me KC), a PhD student in the Rigorous Software Engineering group at
the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) in Germany, supervised by 
[Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/). My main research focus is on the automated systematic verification
of concurrent and distributed software, using dynamic partial order reduction and symbolic execution techniques.
In tandem with my theoretical work on software verification, I also develop practical tools for software model checking.

In particular, I am a core developer of the [**Java Model Checker (JMC)**](https://jmc.mpi-sws.org/), a stateless model 
checker designed for verifying and testing concurrent and distributed Java programs. My current research interests encompass 
formal verification, model checking, concurrency theory, the theory of distributed systems, automata theory, temporal 
logic, and database theory. If you are interested in these topics and would like to chat, please feel free to
reach out!

Before joining MPI-SWS, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the 
[Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu/) in Iran, where I worked on the specification and verification
of timed distributed systems under the supervision of [Ali Movaghar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~movaghar/) and
[Marjan Sirjani](https://marjansirjani.github.io/Marjan-Sirjani/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer 
Engineering from the [Azad University, South Tehran Branch](http://www.azad.ac.ir/) in Iran, where I worked on the 
theory of non-first normal form (NF2) databases under the supervision of Amir Hossein Rouhani Seraji.
