**Hello, visitor!** I'm Mohammad (you can also call me KC), a PhD student in the Rigorous Software Engineering group at
the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) in Germany, supervised by 
[Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/). My main research focus is on the automated systematic verification
of concurrent and distributed software, utilizing dynamic partial order reduction and symbolic execution techniques.
In tandem with my theoretical work on software verification, I also develop practical tools for software model checking.

In particular, I am a core developer of the [Java Model Checker (JMC)](https://jmc.mpi-sws.org/), a stateless model 
checker designed for verifying and testing concurrent and distributed Java programs. My research interests encompass 
formal verification, model checking, concurrency theory, the theory of distributed systems, automata theory, temporal 
logic, and database theory.

Before joining MPI-SWS, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the 
[Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu/) in Iran, where I worked on the specification and verification
of timed distributed systems under the supervision of [Ali Movaghar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~movaghar/) and
[Marjan Sirjani](https://marjansirjani.github.io/Marjan-Sirjani/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer 
Engineering from the [Azad University, South Tehran Branch](http://www.azad.ac.ir/) in Iran, where I worked on the 
theory of non-first normal form (NF2) databases under the supervision of Amir Hossein Rouhani Seraji.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
